My role was to capture business and systems requirements for numerous ongoing projects, and mold the requirements into technical user stories for the Aqovia development scrum team.  This involved understanding numerous 3rd party systems and APIs, and ensuring clarity and consistency in providing technical requirements that were suited to a micro-service architecture.  The requirements were complex and often required detailed process flows and repeated stakeholder engagement to confirm understanding with all parties.      My primary project was the introduction of cloud service products to the Interxion Customer Portal, allowing Interxion's client-base to automatically create and manage cloud service connections to providers such as Amazon (AWS Direct Connect) & Microsoft (Azure ExpressRoute).  Other projects included an internal customer marketplace website, automating customer requests for a physically cabled presence in the 'meet me room', and improving the ordering process for customer-to-customer cross connects. ;London, United Kingdom;;;Metropolitan Police;3839;https://www.linkedin.com/company/3839/;Business Analyst;2014.06;2014.12;I was a business analyst on the Digital Asset Management project within the total technology programme with the aim to provide a single repository for all digital media across the Metropolitan Police.

The company is part of SEWA - a trade union and charity with nearly 2 million members - and is one of a few parts of the organisation where its aim is to strive for profit. Using a small number of shops and hundreds of rural saleswomen across a number of districts in India, RUDI sells high quality cereals, pulses and spices, whilst providing farmers with a fair fee by cutting out the middleman.   My role was to analyse the Surendranagar District of RUDI and create a business plan covering all of the district operations, including deliveries, training, marketing, and operations. This involved conducting market research in rural villages and analysing financial documents to create targets. Upon completion, we presented the business plan and PowerPoint presentation to the senior management of SEWA, and the head of international relations in our respected universities.   It was a wonderful experience that exposed me to real business issues, and allowed me to meet and work with people from a huge range of countries. Our work was extremely well received, and is being implemented by the district and managers. It also helped to create clarity for outsiders who are working with RUDI, as it covered and explained many areas of the business.;Gujarat, India;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Newcastle University;Bachelor’s Degree;Business Management;2012;2015;;York College;High School;Extended Level 3 Diploma in Business;2009;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Business Analysis : null,Leadership : null,Project Management : null,Teamwork : null,Microsoft Word : null,Strategy : null,Management : null,International Relations : null,Hospitality : null;;;;;;;;;;https://www.facebook.com/michael.lees.5492;;;added;;;0;;;;;;;283;DISTANCE_3;283;false;27 сентября 2022 г. 17:15:11;30 сентября 2022 г. 13:24:16;Ilona Marchenko;Hi Michael, we are from Ukraine.

I started my carreer as a business analyst and a sales engineer for telcos, and, at the same time, acquired a master in applied mathematics from Franche-Comté's university.    Since 2002, I've been managing my carreer as an independant information systems consultant, working mainly for small to medium businesses, and often for  the founders of SMEs, some of which have been successful such as ATEXO (100 employees today) or Relaytion-Meilleur-Contact (600 employees today).  Beyond words, I strongly believe that the pride of a team is built through its achievements.   My area of proficiency includes IT infrastructure management, data processing and a salt pinch of security. My commitment to medium businesses helps me  keep my feet wet working on either technical or very operational projects.   After many years when I was dedicated to others'businesses development, I'm now focused on the development of ISITIX, which I co-founded in 2002. I'm confident that this new adventure will bring a full bunch of innovation, pragmatism, professionalism and the satisfaction of an amazingly well-done  work.
