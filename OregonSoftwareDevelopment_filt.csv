We have just started a new initiative called the Buildly Foundry.  It’s a way for us to onboard pre-seed and seed stage startups as well as enterprise Innovation projects on to the Buildly Platform.  We are looking for developers and dev agencies to partner with and be part of a free marketplace offering to each of these new startups.  The first step is to sign up for admission to the Foundry as a development partner here:  https://buildly.io/developer-partnerships/  If you join the Foundry you will get: * a marketplace entry and listing * a simple three step process for certification with Buildly and a few other Open Source tools   * a chance to pitch the startups in each Foundry class * access to a community of startups and Innovation Labs that need an alternative to CTO as a service or Low Code tools  This Winter will be our first Foundry class starting in January 2022.  If you sign up before December 1, 2021 we will waive the signup fee for joining the marketplace and give you a 50% discount off our customer contract and introduction fee.  Hope to hear soon that you have submitted the form and you’re ready to get started helping us craft better software.  Thanks,  Greg Lind CEO - Buildly;January 4, 2022 06:18:08 PM;Eugene Velboi;Hi Greg,  I decided to reach out quickly and see if you are planning to hire remote developers anytime soon.  I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers here. With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.  How about I send you a few CVs along with the cost so that you can see the difference. Have time for a quick call?  Looking forward to your response, Eugene   Eugene Velboi;January 4, 2022 01:52:38 PM;910161ae72efe9348dd13663ecb72efd

I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers here. With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.  How about I send you a few CVs along with the cost so that you can see the difference. Have time for a quick call?

I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers here. With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.  How about I send you a few CVs along with the cost so that you can see the difference. Have time for a quick call?

With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.

I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers here. With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.  How about I send you a few CVs along with the cost so that you can see the difference. Have time for a quick call?  Looking forward to your response, Eugene   Eugene Velboi;January 5, 2022 02:31:58 PM;57232a32855fee35372fa2274cd60c37

Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.

I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers here. With that being said, if you have a need, our model of building dedicated development teams, would not only be more cost-effective but also a lot more convenient.  Cost of course is not the only factor and this model is not for everyone, so although we cover things such as recruitment, retention, infrastructure, and support, it would still be great to hop on a call and dive a bit deeper into our model and learn more about your needs.  How about I send you a few CVs along with the cost so that you can see the difference. Have time for a quick call?
